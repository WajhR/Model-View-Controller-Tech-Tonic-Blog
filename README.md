## The Challenge:

The challenge of building this application involved creating a scalable and robust platform that could support multiple users, blog post and comments. The application was designed with security in mind, allowing users to authenticate themselves and protect their personal data. Furthermore, the application had to be built using modern web development technologies and follow best practices, including the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

  
## Installation

1. The user must first run the schema.sql file on their MySQL server to create the tech-blog database. 
2. The user can then start the server using Node.
3. Then go to http://localhost:3001 in browser to test the site.
4. In order to create posts, the user must login on the Login page or create an account on the Sign Up page
